<b>Стиль интерьера:</b> <i><u>Мягкий минимализм.</u></i>

<code>Photorealistic living room in a soft minimalist style — warm, tactile, serene, premium. Beige-greige palette, soft diffused daylight through sheer curtains, wide-plank light oak floor, smooth hand-troweled plaster walls in warm ivory. Low sculptural furniture: curved boucle sofa, matching lounge chair, organic travertine coffee table with rounded edges, low oak console with ceramic vessels and stacked books. Subtle human presence: linen throw, ceramic cup, single open book — no clutter. Tonal color accents only: ivory, oat, sand, greige; no bold hues or graphic patterns. Quiet layered lighting: daylight from the left, warm cove lighting above, slim floor lamp with fabric shade; atmosphere calm, contemplative, lived-in. Clean proportions, gentle curves, honest natural materials, no decorative excess, no surreal geometry. Shot at eye level (about 1.3 m), 3/4 room view, 35 mm lens, photorealistic global illumination, accurate PBR materials, soft natural shadows, ultra-high resolution.</code>

<code>Photorealistic minimalist interior in Biophilia 2.0 style — calm, tactile, and wellness-oriented. Living moss walls integrated into architectural panels, with dense textures and depth; soil-free or hydroponic systems embedded seamlessly. Warm natural daylight from floor-to-ceiling windows and skylights; soft reflected light from natural surfaces; shadows delicate and diffused.

<b>Стиль интерьера:</b> <i><u>Ци & Модерн.</u></i>

<code>Photorealistic living room in refined fusion style — Chinese minimalism meets Russian modernism. Spatial calm and controlled negative space; clean lines, light neutral walls, and open-plan composition. Chinese minimalism expressed through thin wooden lattice screens, axial symmetry, natural wood tones, and minimal partitions to preserve openness. Russian modernism interpreted through ornamental geometry, sculptural vertical accents, and decorative tile or metal details with restrained patterning. Palette in neutral tones: ivory, oat, warm grey, walnut, and matte stone; no bold contrasts. Furniture contemporary and understated: light upholstered sofa, wooden dining set, slim brass or dark metal lighting. Soft natural daylight from large windows; layered sheer curtains; gentle shadows; atmosphere calm and architectural.

<code>Photorealistic living room in minimalist style with delicate Gothic and eclectic accents.
Spatial composition calm and open, with controlled negative space and light neutral walls (ivory, warm grey, oat). Gothic cues expressed subtly through slender arches, elongated vertical lines, pointed profiles and tracery-inspired patterns — refined, architectural, non-ecclesiastical. Eclectic elements introduced as curated objects: sculptural ceramics, abstract artwork, vintage metal lighting, and a single ornate piece with historical character — balanced, not overwhelming. Materials: matte plaster, natural stone, warm wood, soft textiles, satin bronze or blackened steel details. Neutral palette and desaturated tones: ivory, sand, stone, charcoal; no bold saturated color. Furniture contemporary and minimal: low upholstered sofa, simple wooden tables, slim lighting fixtures, no clutter. Soft natural daylight from tall windows; layered warm artificial lighting for depth; gentle shadows emphasize verticality and texture. Maintain real-world scale, clean proportions, tactile PBR materials, no surreal distortions, ultra-high resolution.</code>
